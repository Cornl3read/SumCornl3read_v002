noteHeyThereDesc,items,Item,,, Hey! You were provided some supplies in the starter bundle on your hot bar to get you going in a hurry. Open it up but don't drink the CornLicker until you are ready to FIGHT. You will have 3 minutes to prepare after drinking it so BE CAREFUL. Make sure to check your inventory often for new items. Good Luck-Cornl3read
