noteHeyThereDesc,items,Item,,, Hey! Thanks for reading this. First you should take some time to gather your thoughts. You were provided some supplies in the starter bundle on your hotbar to get you going in a hurry. Open it up but don't drink the CornLicker until you are ready to die. You will have 3 minutes to prepare after drinking it so BE CAREFUL. Make sure to check your inventory often for new items. Good Luck-Cornl3read
